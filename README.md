# STARS-Project-2015

Unresolved binaries whose parts come close to the minimum mass for hydrogen burning (0.07 Solar Masses) play an important role in the understanding of the very lowest mass stars. We present a methodology to characterize and analyze the spectra of these very lowest mass stars known as brown dwarfs. In this paper I use the BDEVOPAR routines developed in SPLAT, a program ran in Python, on one particular source of interest SDSS J14532589+1420418 to calculate the age and mass of its L1+-0.0 primary and a T6+-0.1 secondary components. Using the index selection methods described in Bardalez Gagliuffi et al. (2014) and the binary fitting methods described in Burgasser et al. (2010), I characterize this unresolved binary and show that its spectral components have unusual properties: slightly blue J-K colors when compared to the median standard for L1 dwarfs, low-metallicity, and field gravity, the highest classification out of the three types (very-low, intermediate, and field).
